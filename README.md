# SOA vs AOS

This repository is a set of demonstrations of exactly how bit of a deal data locality is. Each of the benchmark scripts runs a task, like a linear search or an update loop, on two data sets. Both sets are exactly the same, except that one is organized as a "Structure of Arrays (SOA)" and the other is arranged as an "Array of Structures."

In every case, the SOA format is significantly faster, but don't take my word for it. See for yourself!
